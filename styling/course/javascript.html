               data. JavaScript is high-level, dynamic and browser interpreted programming language, supported by all
               modern web browsers. Apart from web browser, JavaScript is also used to build scalable web applications
               using Node JS. JavaScript is also being used widely in game development and Mobile application
               development.</p>
          <p>JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language. It is designed for creating network-centric
               applications. It is complimentary to and integrated with Java. JavaScript is very easy to implement
               because it is integrated with HTML. It is open and cross-platform.
