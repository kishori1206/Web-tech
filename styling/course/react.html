          <h1>React JS Introduction</h1>
          <p>ReactJS is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building reusable UI components.
               It is an open-source, component-based front end library which is responsible only for the view layer of
               the application. It was initially developed and maintained by Facebook and later used in its products
               like WhatsApp & Instagram.</p>
          <p>
               A ReactJS application is made up of multiple components, each component responsible for outputting a
               small, reusable piece of HTML code. The components are the heart of all React applications. These
               Components can be nested with other components to allow complex applications to be built of simple
               building blocks. ReactJS uses virtual DOM based mechanism to fill data in HTML DOM. The virtual DOM works
               fast as it only changes individual DOM elements instead of reloading complete DOM every time.
          </p>
          <h2>Why To use ReactJs</h2>
          <p>
               The main objective of ReactJS is to develop User Interfaces (UI) that improves the speed of the apps. It
               uses virtual DOM (JavaScript object), which improves the performance of the app. The JavaScript virtual
               DOM is faster than the regular DOM. We can use ReactJS on the client and server-side as well as with
               other frameworks. It uses component and data patterns that improve readability and helps to maintain
               larger apps.
          </p>
          <h2>How To install React</h2>
          <br>
          <h3>Pre-requisite for ReactJS</h3>
          <ol>
               <li>NodeJS and NPM</li>
               <li>Visual Studio</li>
          </ol>
          <p>There are two ways to set up an environment for successful ReactJS application. They are given below.
          </p>
          <ol>
               <li>Using the npm command</li>
               <li>Using the create-react-app command</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Advantages of ReactJS</h2>
          <ol>
               <li>Easy to learn and use</li>
               <li>Creating Dynamic web application becomes easier</li>
               <li>Reuseable Components</li>
               <li>Performance Enhancement</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Disadvantages of ReactJS</h2>
          <ol>
               <li>Poor Documentation</li>
               <li>JSX as a barrier</li>
               <li>View Part</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>React JSX</h2>
          <p>JSX is an HTML-like syntax used by React that extends ECMAScript so that HTML-like syntax can co-exist with
               JavaScript/React code. The syntax is used by preprocessors (i.e., transpilers like babel) to transform
               HTML-like syntax into standard JavaScript objects that a JavaScript engine will parse.

               JSX provides you to write HTML/XML-like structures (e.g., DOM-like tree structures) in the same file
               where you write JavaScript code, then preprocessor will transform these expressions into actual
               JavaScript code. Just like XML/HTML, JSX tags have a tag name, attributes, and children.</p>
          <pre> <p>For Example:    <code>&ltdiv&gt Explore Web-Tech Now &lt/div&gt
               </code> </p></pre>
          <h3>Why use JSX?</h3>
          <ul>
               <li>It is faster than regular JavaScript because it performs optimization while translating the code to
                    JavaScript.</li>
               <li> Instead of separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate files, React uses
                    components that contain both.</li>
               <li>It is type-safe, and most of the errors can be found at compilation time.</li>
               <li>It makes easier to create templates.</li>
          </ul>
